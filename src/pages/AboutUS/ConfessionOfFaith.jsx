        We believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
        <br /><br />
        We believe the Bible is the inspired and infallible Word of God, our rule for faith and practice.
        <br /><br />
        We believe in the virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
        <br /><br />
        We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, and the return of Christ.
