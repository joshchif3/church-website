      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7">
        Founded in the early 1980s, our church began as a small group of believers meeting in homes. 
        <br /><br />
        Through years of faithful ministry, prayer, and evangelism, we have grown into a vibrant community of worshipers across multiple regions.
        <br /><br />
        Our foundation is rooted in biblical teaching, Spirit-led worship, and outreach to the lost and needy.
